# Traffic Policy action catalog

**Generated from ngrok's published Traffic Policy documentation.**

All 26 Traffic Policy actions. This file is the index only. Each action's config fields, result variables, and example live in `actions/<action>.md` - **read only the one(s) you need**, not the whole directory.

## How to read this

- **Phases** - the traffic phases an action may appear in. Putting an action in the wrong phase is a config error, not a no-op.
- **Ends chain** - a terminating action stops the rule chain when it fires. Every Cloud Endpoint policy must end with one; agent endpoints need not.
- Field names in the per-action files are full dotted paths, so they can be read straight into a policy body.
