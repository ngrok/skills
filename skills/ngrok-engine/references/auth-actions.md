# Auth actions reference

Traffic Policy actions that authenticate or restrict callers. Attach any of these in an `on_http_request` rule; combine with a follow-on `deny` rule to restrict which authenticated users pass.

## oauth

Hosted OAuth login with a managed provider. No app code.

```yaml
- type: oauth
  config:
    provider: google   # google | github | microsoft | facebook | gitlab | amazon | linkedin | twitch | ..
```

Restrict after login with a second rule reading the identity:

```yaml
- expressions: ["!actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email.endsWith('@company.com')"]
  actions: [ { type: deny } ]
```

Identity is available as `actions.ngrok.oauth.identity.email` (and other fields per provider).

## openid-connect

Raw OIDC against any compliant IdP (Okta, Auth0, Entra, etc.). Configure the IdP with `https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback` as a redirect URI.

```yaml
- type: openid-connect
  config:
    issuer_url: "https://YOUR_ISSUER"
    client_id: ".."
    client_secret: "${secrets.get('auth','oidc-client-secret')}"
    scopes: [ openid, profile, email ]
```

## jwt-validation

Validate a bearer JWT (for service-to-service / API callers). Use for machine callers where interactive login is wrong.

```yaml
- type: jwt-validation
  config:
    issuer: { allow_list: [ { value: "https://YOUR_ISSUER" } ] }
    audience: { allow_list: [ { value: "your-api" } ] }
    # key source per current docs (JWKS URL or static keys)
```

## basic-auth

Shared username/password. Friendly for a client who won't use an IdP.

```yaml
- type: basic-auth
  config:
    credentials: [ "user:${secrets.get('auth','preview-password')}" ]
```

## restrict-ips (via deny)

Allow-only is `restrict-ips` with an `allow` list. It evaluates CIDRs; a CEL `in`
test compares strings exactly, so it can match a bare address but never a CIDR
(`conn.client_ip` is `203.0.113.4`, which is not the string `203.0.113.4/32`):

```yaml
- actions:
    - type: restrict-ips
      config:
        enforce: true
        allow: ['203.0.113.4/32', '198.51.100.0/24']
```

## Bearer-token gate (used by run-mcp-gateway)

Per-caller bearer tokens matched against Vault secrets, tagging which caller passed:

Reject on the token itself, never on a marker header you added - `x-mcp-caller` is
a request header, so a client can send it and skip the check.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  # strip any client-supplied marker first
  - actions:
      - type: remove-headers
        config: { headers: [x-mcp-caller] }
  # reject on the bearer token, not the marker
  - expressions:
      - "!req.headers['authorization'].exists(v, v == 'Bearer ' + secrets.get('mcp-callers','claude-key'))"
    actions: [ { type: deny, config: { status_code: 401 } } ]
  # only authenticated requests get tagged
  - expressions:
      - "req.headers['authorization'].exists(v, v == 'Bearer ' + secrets.get('mcp-callers','claude-key'))"
    actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config: { headers: { x-mcp-caller: claude } }
```

The canonical multi-provider version of this policy is
`run-mcp-gateway/references/traffic-policy.yaml` - use it rather than re-deriving.
