# `rate-limit`

**Generated from ngrok's published documentation - do not hand-edit.**

Rate limit incoming traffic to your endpoint before it hits your upstream servers.

- **Phases:** `on_http_request`
- **Ends chain:** no
- **Categories:** traffic-control, request-modification

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | A name for this rate limit configuration. Must be less than `1024` characters. |
| `enforce` | boolean | no | Controls whether the rate limit is actively applied at runtime. When enabled, requests exceeding the limit are blocked or throttled as configured. |
| `algorithm` | enum | yes | The rate limit algorithm to be used. Values: `sliding_window` |
| `capacity` | integer | yes | The maximum number of requests allowed to reach your upstream server. The minimum capacity is `1` and the maximum capacity is `2,000,000,000`. |
| `rate` | string | yes | The duration in which events may be limited based on the current capacity. Must be specified as a time duration that is a multiple of ten seconds (for example, `"90s"`, `"10m"`). |
| `bucket_key` | array of strings | yes | The elements of this collection define the unique key of a request to track the rate at which the capacity is being met. Each bucket key is a CEL expression which includes all valid Traffic Policy variables and macros. Values: `req.host` - The Host of the request., `conn.client_ip` - The client IP address., `getReqHeader('X-Example-Header-Name')` - The value for the specified header key, if it exists. |

### Field details

**`enforce`**

Controls whether the rate limit is actively applied at runtime. When enabled, requests exceeding the limit are blocked or throttled as configured. When disabled, the system evaluates the rate limit but does not enforce it, allowing you to test configurations, gather metrics, or return a custom response. The default value is `true`.

**`rate`**

The duration in which events may be limited based on the current capacity. Must be specified as a time duration that is a multiple of ten seconds (for example, `"90s"`, `"10m"`). The minimum value is `"60s"` and the maximum value is `"24h"`.

**`bucket_key`**

The elements of this collection define the unique key of a request to track the rate at which the capacity is being met. Each bucket key is a CEL expression which includes all valid Traffic Policy variables and macros. Up to ten bucket keys can be specified. For multiple buckets, the action will rate limit by each unique combination of buckets.

## Result variables

Readable from `expressions` in later rules once this action has run.

- `actions.ngrok.rate_limit.bucket_key` (string)
- `actions.ngrok.rate_limit.limited` (boolean)
- `actions.ngrok.rate_limit.error.code` (string)
- `actions.ngrok.rate_limit.error.message` (string)

## Example

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: rate-limit
        config:
          name: Only allow 30 requests per minute
          algorithm: sliding_window
          capacity: 30
          rate: 60s
          bucket_key:
            - 'hasReqHeader(''host'') ? getReqHeader(''host'')[0] : ''unknown'''
```
