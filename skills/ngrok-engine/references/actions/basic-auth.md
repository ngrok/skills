# `basic-auth`

**Generated from ngrok's published documentation - do not hand-edit.**

Enforce HTTP Basic Auth for your HTTP endpoints.

- **Phases:** `on_http_request`
- **Ends chain:** no
- **Categories:** security

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `credentials` | array of strings | yes | A list of up to 10 allowed `username:password` credential pairs. Password must be at least `8` characters and no more than `128` characters. Accepts CEL interpolation. |
| `realm` | string | no | The HTTP realm of the request as per RFC 7235 . |
