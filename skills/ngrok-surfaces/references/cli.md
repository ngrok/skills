# Agent CLI and `ngrok.yml`

Source of truth: <https://ngrok.com/docs/gateway/agent/>

The terminal surface. Job skills bring the policy (`ngrok-engine`) and the endpoint
choice (`ngrok-engine`); this file shows how to attach them from a shell.

## One-off agent endpoint

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Attach a Traffic Policy from a file:

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --traffic-policy-file policy.yml
```

Request a reserved domain:

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url https://my-app.ngrok.app
```

Non-HTTP:

```bash
ngrok tcp 22
```

A public TCP endpoint needs a reserved TCP address for a stable URL, and the address
is assigned by ngrok rather than chosen. See `ngrok-engine`.

## Internal endpoint (private receiver)

An internal endpoint has no public URL and is reachable only through a
`forward-internal` action. The `.internal` suffix on the URL is what makes it
internal:

```bash
ngrok http 8080 --url https://billing.internal
```

Internal **TCP** URLs need an explicit port:

```bash
ngrok tcp 22 --url tcp://device-1.internal:22
```

## `ngrok.yml` (declarative agent config)

Version 3 is required.

```yaml
version: 3
agent:
  authtoken: ${NGROK_AUTHTOKEN}
endpoints:
  - name: webhook-receiver
    upstream:
      url: 8080
    traffic_policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: verify-webhook
              config:
                provider: stripe
                secret: ${STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET}
```

Start them:

```bash
ngrok start --all
ngrok start webhook-receiver
```

Prefer `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` in the environment over the `agent.authtoken` key whenever
the config file ships inside an image or a workload you do not fully control.

## Run as a background service

Registers a native OS service (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, a Windows
service). `install` only registers it - `start` is separate, and both usually need
root.

```bash
ngrok service install --config /etc/ngrok.yml
ngrok service start
```

Equivalent to `ngrok start --all`. Prefer the foreground form while first getting a
config right; a service hides its errors in the system log.

## Driving the API from the CLI

Use this path when the ngrok MCP server is not connected. If it is connected, create these resources with its tools and do not ask for an API key. See "Account resources" in `../SKILL.md`.

`ngrok api ..` covers resources that outlive the agent, and takes a policy as a file
instead of an escaped JSON string:

```bash
ngrok api endpoints create \
  --api-key "$NGROK_API_KEY" \
  --type cloud \
  --bindings public \
  --url "https://api.example.com" \
  --traffic-policy-file policy.yml

ngrok api vaults create --name "webhooks"
ngrok api secrets create --name "stripe-signing-secret" --value "whsec_.." --vault-id "$VAULT_ID"
```

Note the credential switch: `ngrok api` needs an **API key**, not the agent
authtoken. See `api.md`.

## Notes for agents

- Run these yourself rather than handing the user instructions.
- The policy YAML is identical to what `ngrok-engine` documents; only
  `--traffic-policy-file` / the `traffic_policy:` block is CLI-specific.
